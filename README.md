### Abstract
Game-based learning(GBL) is one of the most beneficial means of teaching, it suites the changing perception capabilities of students in many fields.Joud is a mobile game application that was developed by virtue of the fact that students are considered to be an important factor in the quality cycle . It aims at increasing studentsâ€™ comprehension of Quality Assurance (QA) and other related concepts, that affect the quality development process in PNU. We conducted a survey to measure students understanding of quality and their role regarding it. The result of the mentioned survey stated that there is a considerable percentage of students who have low to medium level of understanding the quality and a lower level of understanding its importance and their role in the development process. The Deanship of Quality Assurance and Academic Accreditation (QAAA) of  PNU has been providing students with continuous workshops and summer programs and other training programs that are held  in the university campus. However, these workshops and training programs are held using the conventional teaching method. Therefore, it does not take into consideration the changing perception capabilities of students. In Joud, students are expected to answer many different questions that are supposed to increase their level of engagement in the quality process in an enjoyable and interactive environment.
